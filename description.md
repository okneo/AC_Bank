### Functions
AC Bank, the short for Accepted Bank, is a mini project aiming at simulating the system of a real commercial bank.
<br/>We tried to describe our project in the most natural way to the IDE. We neither made it too complex nor made it too simple on purpose.
However, payment interface is not considered in the project, because settling system does not belong to an exact commercial bank.
<br/>The project of simulated bank has three branches of account.
